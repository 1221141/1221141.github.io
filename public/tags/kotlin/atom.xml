        <content type="html" xml:base="https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240324165541-java-vs-kotlin-vs-clojure/">&lt;p&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve been attracted by clojure again. I&#x27;ve always wanted to learn it and use as my main programming language. The main selling point to me, other than being a lisp is that I don&#x27;t nee a full fledge IDE to work with. In my daily work I work with java and kotlin and I feel that I have a extensive rely on a IDE for work with it. In clojure I can use emacs&#x2F;vscode&#x2F;nvim in a more simple setup to work with it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There are very nice things about the language, but I don&#x27;t think I have knowledge enough to make a full fledged product with it. It is more as a toy. And this is bad.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I need to work and create reliable and clean solutions. Coming from java kotlin makes that easier and I feel in a way more elegant. It has the type safety of java and the development joy of ruby.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I think I should focus on learning kotlin since it can be used both for web server development as for android development (which I have no previous experience).&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Now that I wrote this I feel that clojure has not a lot of space. This makes me sad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
