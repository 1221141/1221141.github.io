Life is being constantly adapted to be as efficient and as pleasurable as possible, and as a result, our attention spans are suffering.\nI used to have an awful attention span, I couldn’t sit through a movie without checking my phone several times, I wouldn’t be able to read anything longer than a page, and I would constantly leave tasks partially complete.\nIf this sounds a little bit like you then I’m going to detail how to fix it.\nUnfortunately, this is not a quick and easy fix, and if you have a short attention span you’ll likely be put off this advice for that reason alone. But if the thought of working at something while making gradual improvements discourages you from a goal then you are exactly the type of person who needs this advice.\nFirstly I just want to talk about what a short attention span looks like. You need to have realistic expectations of what this method is going to give you.\nA short attention span is where your interests and intents change rapidly. It is not a lack of motivation and discipline (although you may also have these issues). But rather the inability to remain focused to one task at a time. (Side note: some people may have an attention deficient disorder known as ADD, if you feel your attention span issues are particularly bad, consider consulting a professional)\nHere are some signs you might have a short attention span:\n\n​\n​\nHow to fix you attention span\nSocial media\nI’m sure for most of you seeing this as the first step is not a massive shock. Social media is absolutely destroying your attention span.\nLet’s just think about how social media works; a computer algorithm picks which content is most rewarding TO YOU PERSONALLY. It then displays this content one after the other. Your attention span is being forced to change topics (and is being rewarded for doing so) every couple of seconds. Is it any wonder you struggle to read a book for 20 minutes when you can literally cycle through hundreds of Tiktoks, Tweets or Instagram posts in that time?\nSocial media is giving you intense spikes in dopamine, which is basically your brain's happy hormone. These spikes of dopamine are short but intense, it makes you feel good but it also fades quickly, making you crave another piece of rewarding content. Contrast this with an activity such as reading. Dopamine levels increase slowly but remain for a longer period of time. They will likely not be as intense as the spikes from social media content, but they don’t fade as quickly making you less needing of another dopamine hit.\nMy best advice would be to get rid of your social media completely. I’ve preached the effectiveness of it before soI’m not going to go into it too much in this post. Instead I’ll give you some ways you can adapt your social media use to make it a bit more attention span friendly.\n\n​\nPractice\nThe second thing you need to do to fix your attention span is practice increasing your attention span. This takes time, and at the start especially can be quite frustrating. You need to do things that can help lengthen your attention span. My two best options for these are reading and meditation. These are such effective practises because you can incrementally increase the time spent doing them.\nFor example, if you struggle to read without picking up your phone, set a five minute timer and force yourself to read for that amount of time. The next day do 7, then 10, then 10 a few more times, then 12, then 15 and before you know it you’ll be able to read for 40 minutes and not feel inclined to look at your phone. Meditation is also super effective at this but is a bit more challenging for those with short attention-spans, my best advice for this would be to start with guided meditations, that way your brain is still being stimulated, just to a lesser degree.\n​\nCombine\nThe most important thing about this method is you must do both things simultaneously. You need to reduce short attention activities and add in more attention lengthening activities. By only addressing one aspect of the problem you will fail to gain the benefits.\nEdit: wow this blew up, I love making this kind of content, if you've got value from this then please check out my youtube for more self improvement content 🤙🤙🤙\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240106120235-reddit-dive-into-anything/","title":"Reddit - Dive into anything"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240106122137-making-the-theme-mobile-friendly/":{"body":"Since I am using an old theme for my blog, it is not mobile friendly.\n\\\nSpent some time thinking to make the sidebar disappear and the content take the full space when opening in mobile.\n\\\n\n\\\nNow I need to make some fonts bigger.\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240106122137-making-the-theme-mobile-friendly/","title":"Making the theme mobile friendly"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240106162040-life-of-discipline/":{"body":"Life of Discipline\nFound this whe looking this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyi_g99LygM \n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240106162040-life-of-discipline/","title":"Life of Discipline"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240106164204-save-bookmark-page-to-wordpress/":{"body":"As a continuation of the what I wrote here: Create/ a worpress post with a javascript bookmarklet I created a bookmarklet to create bookmarks.\n\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240106164204-save-bookmark-page-to-wordpress/","title":"Save bookmark page to wordpress"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240106173204-manna-harbour-miryoku-miryoku-is-an-ergonomic-minimal-orthogonal-and-universal-keyboard-layout/":{"body":"https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku\n\n\nUpdate: 2024-01-06 17:31:22 Saturday\nThis keyboard layout is a good base, but to me it has too few keys.

Initially I thought about learning Korean, since I started to have interest in Korean culture and series, but the sounds are too hard, and the grammar is hard as well. Since I had studied previously and have more knowledge about Japanese culture I thought that would be easier to learn.\nAlso there is a lot of material to learn Japanese online in English, but not a lot in Korean. Also Korean grammar is somewhat similar to Japanese, and there are several statements online that the number of material to learn Korean in Japanese is significantly higher.\nSo the current plan is to learn Japanese and when I'm good enough try to learn Korean from it. Meanwhile I will try to get more Korean input and learn Hangul, their writing system.\nSo far I memorized most of the hiragana, katakana is the one I have more difficult.\n&nbsp;\nOne challenge is that I don't like anime and series, But there are several YouTube videos and I like reading manga. I think old school Japanese music can also be a good source of input.\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240203120141-learning-japanese-again/","title":"Learning Japanese Again"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240204154101-japanese-dictionary-and-spaced-repetition-system-jpdb/":{"body":"https://jpdb.io/\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240204154101-japanese-dictionary-and-spaced-repetition-system-jpdb/","title":"Japanese dictionary and spaced repetition system – jpdb"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240204161137-ajatt-narrated-all-japanese-all-the-time-blog-fan-narrated-youtube/":{"body":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPxwS02_wYP0Y7kprP9ZzLhlZjRSAHWv\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240204161137-ajatt-narrated-all-japanese-all-the-time-blog-fan-narrated-youtube/","title":"AJATT: Narrated (All Japanese All The Time Blog - Fan Narrated) - YouTube"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240204172135-japanese-ha-and-ga-particles-in-2-minutes-wa-vs-ga-youtube/":{"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytjRoTwWnzw\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240204172135-japanese-ha-and-ga-particles-in-2-minutes-wa-vs-ga-youtube/","title":"Japanese は and が Particles in 2 Minutes | (WA) vs (GA) - YouTube"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240204222502-a-key-to-japanese-kanji-pronunciation-meet-the-sound-sisterhoods-organic-japanese-with-cure-dolly/":{"body":"https://learnjapaneseonline.info/2014/12/06/the-key-to-japanese-kanji-pronunciation-meet-the-sound-sisterhoods/\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240204222502-a-key-to-japanese-kanji-pronunciation-meet-the-sound-sisterhoods-organic-japanese-with-cure-dolly/","title":"A Key to Japanese Kanji Pronunciation: Meet the Sound Sisterhoods | Organic Japanese with Cure Dolly"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240205130034-learn-japanese-with-takagi-san-youtube/":{"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz0Pzagy_eQ\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240205130034-learn-japanese-with-takagi-san-youtube/","title":"Learn Japanese with Takagi-San - YouTube"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240205134804-japanese-manga-difficulty-list-natively/":{"body":"https://learnnatively.com/search/jpn/books/?type=manga\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240205134804-japanese-manga-difficulty-list-natively/","title":"Japanese Manga Difficulty List | Natively"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240205162613-cornucopia-of-resources/":{"body":"https://djtguide.neocities.org/cor\n","id":"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240205162613-cornucopia-of-resources/","title":"cornucopia of resources"},"https://1221141.github.io/blog/20240205213406-learning-japanese-but-frustrated/":{"body":"I am trying to learn japanese again, but to be honest I'm feeling a bit scared.

I've always wanted to learn it and use as my main programming language. The main selling point to me, other than being a lisp is that I don't nee a full fledge IDE to work with. In my daily work I work with java and kotlin and I feel that I have a extensive rely on a IDE for work with it. In clojure I can use emacs/vscode/nvim in a more simple setup to work with it.\nThere are very nice things about the language, but I don't think I have knowledge enough to make a full fledged product with it. It is more as a toy. And this is bad.\nI need to work and create reliable and clean solutions. Coming from java kotlin makes that easier and I feel in a way more elegant. It has the type safety of java and the development joy of ruby.\nI think I should focus on learning kotlin since it can be used both for web server development as for android development (which I have no previous experience).\nNow that I wrote this I feel that clojure has not a lot of space.
