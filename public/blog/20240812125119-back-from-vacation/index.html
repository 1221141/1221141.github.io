  Back from vacation

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-08-12T12:51:19</strong></p>
<p>took 2 weeks vacation. Went to italy and walked a lot.<br />
Today back to work and I don't want to work.<br />
Started creating my own keyboard. trying a non-sculpt/concave split keyboard. it is easy to iterate since each part is around 1 hour to print.<br />
