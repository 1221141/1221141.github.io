  Learning Japanese but frustrated
</h1>
  
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-02-05T21:34:06</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to learn japanese again, but to be honest I'm feeling a bit scared. It feels that I will take a lot of time to learn, and for some reason I want to learn everything super fast.<br />
I think it will be important to change my mindset first, before burnout and give up again.</p>
