This site is fascinating. Basically everything I've ever wanted. Found it earlier today when learning about micropub. The author is involved in the development of micropub and his website is an inspiration. It tracks absolutely everything on his life, and he owns the whole data.<br />
Since I started writing my notes/blog. I also started to track some aspects, I am going to study his website and try to apply some of the things to my own workflow.</p>
