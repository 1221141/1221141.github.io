<p>My previous 3d printer was an Ender 3 v2. I got it around 2 years ago to print my dactyl keyboards, I had a lot of issues with it and had to do some upgrades to be usable. But had a lot of issues anyway... But to my surprise it broke few weeks ago! I was going to make a new keyboard and the heat sensor broke. I tried to figure it out but couldn't so probably I need to check the motherboard or buy a new sensor.<br />
 <br />
Needless to say, I got tired of fiddling with it and decided to buy a Bambu Lab. I have a friend who bought one and said wonders about it, but I was reluctant about the price. I decided to buy their cheapest one, the A1 mini.<br />
 <br />
It is awesome, the print quality is pretty good. The only downside is that it is too loud. but I am really enjoying it the quality and the speed. I made a new keyboard with it.</p>
