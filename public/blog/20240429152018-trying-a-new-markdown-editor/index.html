  Trying a new markdown editor
</h1>
  
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-04-29T15:20:18</strong></p>
<p>So far my experience with searching a markdown editor has been really frustrating.<br />
I want something that i can self host but at the same time that I can use in my mobile phone. I didn't like obsidian because filenames are the same as the title. I prefer using my own file format.<br />
I've been using wordpress for a while now, and so far I wrote several notes and been using as bookmark as well.<br />
The main problem is that the wordpress editor doesn't support markdown. Trying now another plugin\</p>

Update: Plugin not good</p>
