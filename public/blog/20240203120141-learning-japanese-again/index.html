  Learning Japanese Again
</h1>
  
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-02-03T12:01:41</strong></p>
<p>I decided to start learning Japanese again. Initially I thought about learning Korean, since I started to have interest in Korean culture and series, but the sounds are too hard, and the grammar is hard as well. Since I had studied previously and have more knowledge about Japanese culture I thought that would be easier to learn.<br />
Also there is a lot of material to learn Japanese online in English, but not a lot in Korean. Also Korean grammar is somewhat similar to Japanese, and there are several statements online that the number of material to learn Korean in Japanese is significantly higher.<br />
So the current plan is to learn Japanese and when I'm good enough try to learn Korean from it. Meanwhile I will try to get more Korean input and learn Hangul, their writing system.<br />
So far I memorized most of the hiragana, katakana is the one I have more difficult.<br />
Â <br />
One challenge is that I don't like anime and series, But there are several YouTube videos and I like reading manga. I think old school Japanese music can also be a good source of input.</p>
