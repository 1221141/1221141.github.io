<p>I have never worked with WordPress before, since I've never felt the need to write anything online and when if finally decided the whole static site generators were the new trend.<br />
I tend to really like to keep my own data, so I thought it was the best way to keep my notes and thoughts. But since now I've been self-hosting my own applications it felt that might be ok to at least try wordpress. So far I am liking, but I definitely need to find a way to export the posts to markdown for long time storage.<br />
I've been trying to use the combo {text editor, markdow, git, hugo}, and I really miss something where I can write from my phone.</p>
<h2 id="my-data">My Data</h2>
<p>I want to write and not really spend time tinkering with scripts and renaming stuff. I might need to write another script to export the data from wordpress. But since I am self hosting I can say that the data <strong>is mine</strong> and I can do that in later time.<br />
I also want to automate some posts creations, since I also want to use this to bookmark some websites that I find interesting.<br />
Well, time to spend time learning about wordpress, but I guess this will be repetitively easy, since it has been going from a long time and there is a lot of resources online.</p>
