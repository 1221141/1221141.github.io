  using i3 on laptop
</h1>
  
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-04-14T20:25:19</strong></p>
<p>Decided to try using i3wm again on the laptop. I stopped using tiling window manager for a while now. But I think when i'm in the laptop i would like to avoid using the mouse as much as possible and I usually don't use anything that is super mouse intensive (other than web browsing). Will give this a try again.</p>
