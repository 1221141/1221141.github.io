<p>Recently I've been attracted by clojure again. I've always wanted to learn it and use as my main programming language. The main selling point to me, other than being a lisp is that I don't nee a full fledge IDE to work with. In my daily work I work with java and kotlin and I feel that I have a extensive rely on a IDE for work with it. In clojure I can use emacs/vscode/nvim in a more simple setup to work with it.<br />
There are very nice things about the language, but I don't think I have knowledge enough to make a full fledged product with it. It is more as a toy. And this is bad.<br />
I need to work and create reliable and clean solutions. Coming from java kotlin makes that easier and I feel in a way more elegant. It has the type safety of java and the development joy of ruby.<br />
I think I should focus on learning kotlin since it can be used both for web server development as for android development (which I have no previous experience).<br />
Now that I wrote this I feel that clojure has not a lot of space. This makes me sad.</p>
