  Started writing my own CMS
</h1>
  
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-02-09T17:01:00</strong></p>
<p>I think I mentioned a few times that I'm not 100% satisfied with WordPress, specially that I solely use as a text editor for my "blog".Â  I finally decided to write my own, and I think I have a working prototype. Still in the early stages and there is a lot that I want to do.<br />
The problem with creating my own things is that I tend to focus way more on the customization then in actually using the thing. For now I think I will write something here in WP and then when I have a easy to host solution I will migrate all posts to there and retired my self-hosted wp instance.</p>
