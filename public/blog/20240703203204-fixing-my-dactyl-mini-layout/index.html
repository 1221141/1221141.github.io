<p>Trying a new layout of my dactyl mini. Since I don't have the number row trying now to have a layer with number row and some symbols. It is a bit comfortable, but I'm really slow.<br />
I'm really thinking about buying a glove80 keyboard. The whole DIY thing that I did (buying a 3d printer, soldering etc) was good. But my keyboards are unreliable and break all the time. I spend more time fixing those than using it. They are also cumbersome and hard to transport. The cable management is not good as well.<br />
I think the whole saga was worth it. I learned that I like concave shape, ortholinear and low profile lightweight switches keyboards. Maybe I should buy a professional one. The only think I'm concerned is if I will enjoy or I will regret after spending so much.<br />
