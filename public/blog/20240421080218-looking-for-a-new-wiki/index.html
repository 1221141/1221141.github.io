  Looking for a new Wiki
</h1>
  
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-04-21T08:02:18</strong></p>
<p>So far I've been using my wordpress instance for my notetaking. But it is not well suited for it. (at least so far). I like that i can take random notes, but I think a wiki would be good for linking things together. Maybe I can come up with some solution.</p>
