<p>While I am enjoying playing with WordPress I need to be careful that I always have a markdown backup in place.<br />
I created my python script to do that but the cronjob is not working... might need to write a php one and hookup in WordPress core as a plugin to always create the backup when I create/update a post/page.<br />
<del>I can use Parsedown to convert html to markdown, might investigate that.</del> Parsdown is only from md -&gt; html. I found this library <code>league/html-to-markdown</code> but no success in importing it and using.<br />
☝️following this, I can save the fields I want in JSON. Then I can pipeline tinot another project to transform to markdown. I found that JavaScript ecosystem seems more healthy with html/markdown parsing tools.<br />
I will try write some js code with <code>rehype-remark</code>.\</p>

New Plan:<br />
If i need to write code, I use the markdown editor, if not I can use the classical editor.<br />
Now I need to find a way to parse the html, but I can do that later.<br />
Sure, would be better if the editor was in markdown to begin with, but the plugins are clunky. I think it is better to stay in html. If I have time I can write my own parser. I will investigate the unify hast\</p>
