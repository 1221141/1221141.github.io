  Goshuin

<p>A goshuin is composed of a red stamp, with either the name of the shrine or a Buddhist sutra hand-written in black ink. Each seal is different – some are traditional, others cute, with some being unique works of art that change with the seasons.</p>
<p>You collect goshuin in a [[goshuin-chō]], or prayer seal book. They cost around ¥1500 (£10) if you buy one from a temple or shrine directly. You can also buy goshuinchō from stationery stores although they’re typically a bit more expensive. For example, the two woodcut goshuinchō below were around ¥3000 (£20) each but I’m sure you can see why!</p>
<p>If you’re buying a goshuinchō from a store like Tokyu Hands or Loft, make sure it’s a goshuinchō rather than a notebook – you can usually tell by the fact that goshuinchō pages are folded like an accordion.</p>
