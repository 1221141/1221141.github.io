  Back from vacation

<p>Happy 2025!<br />
I was on vacation since november last year. I think it was one of the longest vacation I've ever took. Now I am back to my routine, but I haven't really had time to plan what to do this year. I think I would like to learn more about clojure, but I'm not really sure. I think I don't have that much energy to learn something just to learn it. I already am spending time learning "human" languages.<br />
I definetly want to get more into fitness and eat better, second half of last year was not good.<br />
I will try to think and see what I should do.</p>
