  Scrapbox vs self-hosted solution
</h1>
  
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-04-21T11:09:45</strong></p>
<p>I started using scrapbox but recently deployed a selfhosted wordpress instance. This makes it easier to have control of the data.<br />
Scrapbox is convenient and more pretty than wordpress. But it is not suitable for online editing. (tried several times, but editor just fails) Migh start using scrapbox as a sole bookmark solution. (create tool to backup and migrate later), and wordpress instance for writing down my thoughts.<br />
What I don't like about wordpress is that the solution is janky... and the editor is not as good. (what if i can have a browser editor that would push the contents to wordpress?)<br />
One way would be to have the content first in scrapbox and then later convert to html an post to wordpress....</p>
