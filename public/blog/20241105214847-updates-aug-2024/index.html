<p>I've been writing less and less, here are some updates.<br />
* Going to the gym 3 times a week, (for more than a month now) * Studying japanese everyday (around 1 hour of anki + random videos with grammar and vocab) * using more neovim than emacs since I can't have UI programs in my WSL at work * thinking about learning golang again, but not project in mind, rails is easier to get something quick * Rewatching LOST, current in the second season * Watched [Agatha All Along](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15571732/) in two days.<br />
I also ate Japchae [잡채] for the first time. I liked.</p>
